Integrates the MyVideoRoom Service into WordPress

== Description ==

Integrate Video with E-Commerce, Social Networking and Bookings ClubCloud brings to market a novel video conferencing plugin that allows for diverse integration with, otherwise quite separated, website functionality.
The My Video Room Plugin enables you to not just add video chat or meeting functionality to a website but to fully embed it into the wider functions of any platform.

Features include:
* 1-to-1 or multiway meetings
* Up to 30 participants per meeting (more can be catered for on request)
* Admin control on mute, kick-out etc…
* Lobby function for extra layer of security
* Video Reception gives meeting attendees something to watch while waiting
* Screen share
* Video recording
* YouTube Video sharing (depending browser settings)
* 100% tailorable video meeting themes

Full functionality is FREE with a basic licence!

That’s right!! We are giving you the full capabilities of ClubCloud to use on a site in the basic licence option.

Beyond that there is no need for any further plugin downloads. Simply upgrade your licence to allow for more simultaneous users and concurrent video sessions. We charge on a per user per month basis for any platforms you deploy My Video Room on.

Organising a video meeting made easy with an active reception option for participants. Video rooms can be configured with a waiting area to avoid un-expected visitors.

ClubCloud offers a Video Reception function which is included as a parameter in the shortcode [reception=true]. The Welcome message is configurable to be instance appropriate.

The Reception includes a message to tell users that they are in a waiting space until their host accepts them into the video chat.
